The **StandardWindow** is a control meant to replicate the standard Guild Wars 2 windows.

|Implements| |
|-|-|
|Container|This control is a container meaning it can contain other controls and containers.|
|IViewContainer|This control can act as a view container allowing you to show it with a view specified.|
|IWindow|This control acts as a window meaning its ZIndex will update to bring it to the front of other windows when interacted with.|

Windows require a background and their size and content regions will be subsets of the background's bounds.

When creating a new **StandardWindow**, you must provide:

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
|background|The texture to be used as the background of the window.|
|windowRegion|The bounds which represent the "rigid" portion of the window - just inside of the softer outer border.|
|contentRegion|The bounds within the space that should represent the `ContentRegion`.  This is where the view / child controls will be displayed.|

In this example, we've used window background [asset 155985](https://assets.gw2dat.com/155985.png).

```cs
var exampleWindow = new StandardWindow(
      ContentsManager.GetTexture("controls/window/155985"), // The background texture of the window.
      new Rectangle(40, 26, 913, 691),              // The windowRegion
      new Rectangle(70, 71, 839, 605)               // The contentRegion
);
```

## Usage Example

```cs
var exampleWindow = new StandardWindow(ContentsManager.GetTexture("controls/window/155985"), new Rectangle(40, 26, 913, 691), new Rectangle(70, 71, 839, 605))
{
      Parent        = GameService.Graphics.SpriteScreen,
      Title         = "StandardWindow",
      Emblem        = ContentsManager.GetTexture("controls/window/156022"),
      Subtitle      = "Example Subtitle",
      SavesPosition = true,
      Id            = $"{nameof(ExampleClass)}_ExampleModule_38d37290-b5f9-447d-97ea-45b0b50e5f56"
};

exampleWindow.Show(new OverlaySettingsView());
```
