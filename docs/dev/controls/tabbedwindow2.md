The **TabbedWindow2** is a control meant to replicate the standard Guild Wars 2 windows with tabs.  **TabbedWindow2**s are much like **[StandardWindows](standardwindow)** except **TabbedWindow2**s have tabs.

:::caution

There exists another window control, **TabbedWindow** which is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future version - do not use **TabbedWindow**.  Use this control, **TabbedWindow2**, instead.

:::

|Implements| |
|-|-|
|Container|This control is a container meaning it can contain other controls and containers.|
|IViewContainer|This control can act as a view container allowing you to show it with a view specified.|
|IWindow|This control acts as a window meaning its ZIndex will update to bring it to the front of other windows when interacted with.|

Windows require a background and their size and content regions will be subsets of the background's bounds.

When creating a new **TabbedWindow2**, you must provide:

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
|background|The texture to be used as the background of the window.|
|windowRegion|The bounds which represent the "rigid" portion of the window - just inside of the softer outer border.|
|contentRegion|The bounds within the space that should represent the `ContentRegion`.  This is where the view / child controls will be displayed.|

In this example, we've used window background [asset 155997](https://assets.gw2dat.com/155997.png).

```cs
var exampleWindow = new TabbedWindow2(
      ContentsManager.GetTexture("controls/window/155997"), // The background texture of the window.
      new Rectangle(24, 30, 545, 630),              // The windowRegion
      new Rectangle(82, 30, 467, 600)               // The contentRegion
);
```

:::info Accounting for the sidebar

When using a **TabbedWindow2**, a black sidebar (which has the tabs on it) will be shown on the left side of the window.  This will cut into your `windowRegion`.  Account for this by including at least **46** of space between the left side of your `windowRegion` and your `contentRegion`.

## Usage Example

```cs
var exampleWindow = new TabbedWindow2(ContentsManager.GetTexture("controls/window/155985"), new Rectangle(24, 30, 545, 630), new Rectangle(82, 30, 467, 600)) 
{
      Parent        = GameService.Graphics.SpriteScreen,
      Title         = "TabbedWindow",
      Emblem        = ContentsManager.GetTexture("controls/window/156022"),
      Subtitle      = "Example Subtitle",
      SavesPosition = true,
      Id            = $"{nameof(ExampleClass)}_ExampleModule_38d37290-b5f9-447d-97ea-45b0b50e5f56"
};

exampleWindow.Tabs.Add(new Tab(ContentsManager.GetTexture("155052"), () => new OverlaySettingsView(), "Settings"));
exampleWindow.Tabs.Add(new Tab(ContentsManager.GetTexture("155052"), () => new AboutView(), "About Blish HUD"));
```
